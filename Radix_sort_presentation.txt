1.Idea
//-----------------------
RadixSort is a distribution-sorting algorithm. Thus, it does not compare the items of an array.
The objective is to create groupings of data elements and then combine them to sort a collection of data.
//-----------------------
RadixSort reorders components in what way? 
    Iteration 1: Creating groupings based on the right-most digit, which is the least significant. 
                 Bringing these groups together. 
    Iteration 2: Creating groupings based on the next-to-last digits 
                 Bringing these groups together. 
    So on....
    
    *For items with more than one significant digit,
this bucketing procedure is repeated for each digit, 
while maintaining the previous step's ordering, 
until all digits have been processed.
