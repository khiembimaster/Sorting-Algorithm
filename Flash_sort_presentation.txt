1.Idea
//-----------------------
FlashSort is a classification/distribution sorting algorithm such as countingSort, radixSort, and, especially, bucketSort.
As a result, the main idea of the flashSort algorithm is to classify elements into smaller buckets or classes. 
Then flashSort in-place permutes elements into their appropriate buckets, which helps flashSort outweigh its counterparts. 
After the permutation, the original array becomes nearly sorted.
Intentionally, this distribution of elements is insertionSort's best case, which is an order of O(n).
//-----------------------
Overall, the flashSort consists of three logical blocks: CLASSIFICATION, PERMUTATION, and STRAIGHT INSERTION.
    CLASSIFICATION --> determines the size of each class of elements and their positions.
    PERMUTATION does --> long-range (the whole array) reordering to collect elements of each class together. 
    STRAIGHT INSERTION --> does the final short-range (each small bucket) ordering.

2.Step-by-step description
//-----------------------
a.CLASSIFICATION
In this pharse, the algorithm finds the number of buckets (stored by m) and their size (stored by an array-l[]) with the size of m elements.
    m will be the floor of multiplication of a constant (0.45) and the number of elements (n).

Assume that the values in bucket[0] <= bucket[1] <= ... <=bucket[k] ... <= bucket[m-1].
                          
To find where arr[i] belongs,
    Firstly, find the max and min values by scanning through the arr[].
    Let arr[i] represent one of the elements in the given array.
    Let k be the class of arr[i], that 
        (1) k(arr[i]) = [(m - 1) / (max - min)] * (arr[i] - min) 
        (*) In the source code, i'm using variable c1 = (m - 1) / (max - min)
                (!) Here, (m - 1) / (max - min) should be explicitly cast with a floating-point type.
                This will improve the precision of the value supplied to c1.
        (2) k (arr[i]) = c1 * (arr[i] - min).
            The result, k, will be a value from 0 to m-1.
            This function would help find the bucket where arr [i] should be placed.
            Note:   min--------arr[i]---------------------------------------max
                    |(arr[i] - min)|
                    |-----------------(max - min)-----------------------------|
                    |k = 0||k = 1| ...................................|k = m-1|
                    
                Divide (m-1) into the distance between the maximum and minimum equal fields.
                The size of each field is approximately c1 = (m-1)/(max-min).
                As a result, the field of arr [i] is as follows: k = round of [c1* (distance between arr [i] and min)]
                Alternatively, k = [c1 * (arr [i]-min)] 

            Note: Since using (1) to calculate k, the calculation will ask for additional memories,
            which causes the previous version using the first (1) method to crash when the input size is over 100'000. 
            Thus, (2) will help enormously improve the performance more than (1) does.

As the main part of this pharse, the second for-loop will scan through all elements, get their k(arr [i]), and sum up the appropriate l[k].
Then it accumulates the sum of l[k]. As a result, we have a prefix sum array that helps determine where a bucket ends.
**for more detail, the last position of a bucket will be l[k]-1.

b.PERMUTATION
Here, flashSort assigns elements to the appropriate class.
Clearly, before moving one element(flash = arr[j]) to a new location(t = (l[k]-1)), we have to move that old one(arr[t]) away. 
Let's use a variable(hold) to store the value of the removed item.
We may then calculate its new location(l[k(new_flash)]) and permute until we finish a cycle(j = l[k]).
Then, if variable(move) is still less than n-1, we can say that every element is not moved,
we will find the next value of j that arr[j] is not placed in its correct class- cycle leader- and continue the above process.

c.STRAIGHT INSERTION
Finally, we have a mostly sorted array to deal with after the permutation phase has shifted everything into nearly the correct position.
Thus, it's time to use a simple-comparison-sort algorithm, insertionSort, to arrange each bucket, whose size is constant.

3.Complexity evaluations
a.Time Complexity
    In all cases, T(n) = O(n) = Classification(n)(1) + Permutation(n)(2) + Straight_insertion(n)(3).
    
    (1)Classification(n) = O(n) =
                            scanning the input to find the size of each class = O(n)
                        +   adding up the class sizes to determine the initial L(K) values = O(m < n)
                        +   find max and min = O(n) 
    (2)Permutation(n) = O(n). since Each item is moved once, and j scans through the entire array at most once. 
    
    Assuming the classes are about the same size, this requires O((n/m)^2) = O(1) time for each class, so that
    (3)Straight_insertion(n) = O(n)*O(1) = O(n).
b.Space Complexity
    To hold the number of items in each class, we'll need an array *l of size m. 
    However, as m = 0.45*n, it appears to be significantly smaller than the amount of additional memory required by countingSort and radixSort to achieve a runtime complexity of O(n).
